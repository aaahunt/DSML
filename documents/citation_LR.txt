[Points:
1. Afterwards, for each window, features extraction was performed to be utilized in ML algorithms, as they require 
    handcrafted features.[1] 
2. The classification problems were investigated by both ML and DL approaches[1] 
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)[1][3]

6. Particularly, both DL models and SVM outperformed the KNN and RF.[1]

[Points: 
1. This study integrated accelerometer data from 4 different human activities [2]

Paper3 : Hand gesture recognition using Multiclass Support Vector Machine 
[Points: 
1. With the development of technology and computing, computer is becoming more and more important in our day today 
   life.[3] 
2. Hand gestures can be classified in two categories: static and dynamic.[3][6]   
3. HMM[3] 
4. The idea is to extend it to multi-class problem is to decompose an M-class problem into a series of two-class 
    problems(can be used) [3] 
5. An efficient hand gesture recognition system requires higher class robustness, accuracy and efficiency.[3] ] 


Paper4: Hand Gesture recognition using K-means clustering and Support Vector Machine
[Points:
Hand gestures as media for communication can deliver message to achieve information[4]
 V.N. Vapnik’s SVM has been proved both theoretically and practically to be a successful machine learning model in classification and regression [4] 
Multiclass SVM is an expansion of the binary classification introduced by Vapnik.[4]
Multiclass proposes DDAG strategy for classifying. [4] ]


Paper5: Recognition of Space-Time Hand Gestures using Hidden Markov Model 
[Points: 
As for the recognition of the continuous, connected hand movement patterns, HMM- based segmentation method is introduced.[5] 
To smooth the raw data that can have noise from the tracker or from the hand movement itself,   the fixed-size window averaging is applied to the sample points. [5]
Some of the typical pattern recognition approaches like feature-based classification and the artificial neural network doesn’t seem to fit in this problem since they are more appropriate for modeling and recognizing the static pattern. 
HMM is more natural and effective in extracting and recog­ nizing the spatio-temporally dynamic pattern. ]

Paper6 : Static Hand Gesture Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network with Data  Augmentation. 
[Points:
Conventional models for pattern recognition cannot process natural data in raw form [6]
CNN, a class of deep learning neural network, can extract features on the fly and fully connected layers can be used for classification[6]. 
The extraction process is tedious and every pos- sible feature may not be extracted. Moreover, the extraction may become human-biased. [6]
The activation function used in this layer is Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). ReLU was applied to introduce non-linearity [1][6] 
The library Keras was used for building the CNN classifier.[1][6] 
 We can say after this research that CNN is a data driven methodology and data augmentation has a huge effect in deep learning.[6]

Paper 9: Static hand gesture recognition using an android device 
[Points:
To extract the features of air gesture we used statistical technique which is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 
Gesture Recognition is a way for machines to understand human body language, thus bridging a gap between machines and humans.]
