[Points:
1. Afterwards, for each window, features extraction was performed to be utilized in ML algorithms, as they require 
    handcrafted features.[1] 
2. The classification problems were investigated by both ML and DL approaches[1] 
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)[1][3]  
4. Random Forest (RF)[1]  
5. K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) [1] 
6. Particularly, both DL models and SVM outperformed the KNN and RF.[1] 
7. CNN[1] 
8. CNN-LSTM[1]

Paper 2: Detecting Medication-Taking Gestures Using Machine Learning and Accelerometer Data Collected via Smartwatch Technology: Instrument Validation Study  
[Points: 
1. This study integrated accelerometer data from 4 different human activities [2]
2. Network training is a process in which a ML algorithm is fed sufficient training data to learn from.[2]

Paper3 : Hand gesture recognition using Multiclass Support Vector Machine 
[Points: 
1. With the development of technology and computing, computer is becoming more and more important in our day today 
   life.[3] 
2. Hand gestures can be classified in two categories: static and dynamic.[3]  
3. HMM[3] 
4. The idea is to extend it to multi-class problem is to decompose an M-class problem into a series of two-class 
    problems(can be used) [3] 
5. An efficient hand gesture recognition system requires higher class robustness, accuracy and efficiency.[3]
