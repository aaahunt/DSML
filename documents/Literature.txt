"The highest performance was achieved using a convolutional neural network with long- short term memory (CNN-LSTM)"
"The pre-processing step consisted of a fourth-order low-pass Butterworth filtering with a cut-off frequency of 5 Hz. Such frequency was chosen due to the frequency content of the acquired signals, which was below 5–6 Hz, as verified by Fourier power spectrum analysis. The pre-processing also included raw signal standardization: each signal acquired with the MMR sensors was centered to have zero mean and standard deviation equal to one."
"Concerning ML approaches, inspired by human activity recognition work in the literature, the following classifiers were evaluated: Support Vector Machine (SVM) [19,20], Random Forest (RF) [21] and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) [22]."
"The complete dataset, composed of 22 subjects, was divided into training/validation and test sets using leave-one-subject-out cross validation. As concerns ML methods, the training/validation dataset was split into 5 folds, and grid search-based 5-fold cross validation was used for tuning the hyperparameters. As concerns DL methods, validation was performed on 20% of the training/validation set."
"In multi-gesture classification, CNN and CNN-LSTM performed better than ML methods, with CNN-LSTM resulting in the highest balanced accuracy"
"In the binary classification, the highest f1-score and precision values were obtained with CNN"

"Support vector machine (SVM) [5,8,9,10] and hidden Markov model (HMM) [11,12,13] are two typical machine learning methods in pattern recognition."
"SVM usually needs careful feature extraction and selection, as well as other traditional ML algorithms like naïve Bayes (NB), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and decision tree (DT) [16]."
"For time sequential signals, recurrent neural networks (RNN) allow information to persist. Thus, we can make full use of the contextual information of the sequence. However, RNN might suffer from a vanishing gradient problem with long data sequences. To solve this problem, Hochreiter et al. designed a special RNN, the long short-term memory (LSTM) network that can learn long dependencies [26]."
