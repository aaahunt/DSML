## Useful information

### Data collection procedure
https://phyphox.org app

Data to collect: Acceleration (without g)

1. Moving your phone in a circle 
2. Waving 
3. Gesturing “come here” 
4. Gesturing “go away”

Do each gesture continuously for 15 repetitions (without stopping). Make 8 to 10 sets

### Some notes for data collecting:
- Please export using CSV (Comma, decimal point)
- It is much easier to do the remote access as you can download straight to your laptop/pc
 - The python script move.py does the annoying work of unzipping and organising the raw data files - there is an .exe version so you can just run that (from the same directory as your downloaded zip files)
